#Exercises 9

#a)	We do not need to put “then” and we need to defined x.
#b)	We need to defined x and y, then specify that it is from math that we import “sqrt”
 
#c)	We need to specify what x and y are, 
# Code : 
x = int(input("enter a number"))
if x == 1:
    y = x +1
    print(x)
    print(y)
 
 
#d)	We need to put grade as an integer then put (‘) instead of (“) for the letterGrade, put the letterGrade F like the others and not at the first position and put elif instead of if after the first one

#Code : grade = int(input("enter your grade : "))
if grade >= 90 :
            print("letterGrade = 'A'")
elif grade >= 80 :
            print("letterGrade = 'B'")
elif grade >= 70 :
            print("letterGrade = 'C'")
elif grade >= 60 :
            print("letterGrade = 'D'")
elif grade >= 50 :
            print("letterGrade = 'F'")
