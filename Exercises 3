#Exercises 3 
#Because we need to specify that they are two numbers each and no letter or something else, then we want to print the number as a number so we put it as a string. 
#Code : 
number1 = input("Enter first number")
number2 = input("Enter second number")
result = int(number1) + int(number2)
print("The result is " + str(result))
